# To-Do List Application

This repository contains a simple To-Do List application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as part of my remote internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTION, where I worked as a web developer.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks to the list by entering text in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Check/Uncheck Tasks**: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, which toggles a strikethrough effect.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete (Ã—) button next to each task.
- **Data Persistence**: The list of tasks is saved in the browser's local storage, so tasks remain even after the page is refreshed.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the application.
2. **style.css**: The CSS file that contains the styles for the application.
3. **control.js**: The JavaScript file that implements the functionality of the application.
